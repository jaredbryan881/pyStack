# pyStack
This is a Python implementation of various time series stacking algorithms, along with validations using ambient noise cross-correlations.
For a Matlab implementation, see https://github.com/kura-okubo/ccstack.m.

Implemented stacking algorithms include: linear, robust, selective, and phase-weighted stacking.
